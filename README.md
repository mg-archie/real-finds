# Real Finds

## Description

 We were motivated to create a place for buyers, sellers and agents to connect and view real estate.  We built this after identifying a compartmentalization of the real estate industry where buyers, sellers and agents are often all using different platforms and getting different information making the industry very fragmented.  This app aims to solve that issue. We learnt the importance of proper routing, database structure and frontend utility. 

## Installation

## Usage
